# LLM Prompts ðŸ§ 

![big brain 400 IQ 4D chess omegalul](https://github.com/bjornbryggman/Prompts/blob/main/Images/big%20brain.png?raw=true)

A collection of prompts that I've made for my own use.

They're all based on handpicked prompts from https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts, which have then been re-formatted according to a standardized structure. I've found that this greatly increases the performance of the LLMs overall. Furthermore, I've suffixed some of the well-known methods of improving the output quality of LLMs at the end of each prompt, such as using Chain-of-Thought, adding emotional contexts, tipping, and more.

All prompts are listed below, and are also available as a CSV file.

Enjoy.

They have all been seperated into distinct categories, and generalized where appropriate for ease of use.

Everything is released under the MIT license.

Regarding Temperature and Top P - these are variables that influence the creativity of the AI model and to which extent it adheres to the prompt.

If you're using ChatGPT, this is not relevant for you as these options are not available for ChatGPT users.

If you are using the API, however, and would like to know more about these variables, you can refer to the image below for some examples.
