A collection of prompts that I use for my GPTs and personal use.

They have all been seperated into distinct categories, and generalized where appropriate for ease of use.

Everything is released under the MIT license.

Regarding Temperature and Top P - these are variables that influence the creativity of the AI model and to which extent it adheres to the prompt.

If you're using ChatGPT, this is not relevant for you as these options are not available for ChatGPT users.

If you are using the API, however, and would like to know more about these variables, you can refer to the image below for some examples.
