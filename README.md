# LLM Prompts ðŸ§ 

---

A collection of prompts that I've made for my own use, all formatted according to a standardized structure. I've found that this increases the performance of the LLMs overall. Some of the templates are also suffixed with some of the well-known methods of improving the output quality of LLMs, such as using Chain-of-Thought, adding emotional contexts, tipping, and more. However, I usually prefer to use such methodology during the conversation itself rather in the system prompt, so it's not the norm in these examples.

Included in each prompt is also a section regarding suggested LLM settings. These are not supposed to be included in the prompt, but are rather meant to be used to adjust the LLM settings for that specific prompt, as the name suggests. For more information regarding these settings, have a look at the settings.md file in this repository.

Lastly, I would just like to mention that these are base prompts and are meant to be further adjusted according to your specific needs. For example, if you're using the Advertiser prompt to help you develop content for marketing campaigns, it would be much more effective if you also include previous examples of content that your company has used. This way, the LLM is able to better understand your brand and messaging, which of course positively impacts the overall results of its' generations.

All prompts are listed below, and are also available as a CSV file.

If you would like to build your own custom prompt according to this template, I've outlined the process in the template.md file located in this repository.

Enjoy.
