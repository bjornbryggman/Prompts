# LLM Prompts ðŸ§ 

![big brain 400 IQ 4D chess omegalul](https://github.com/bjornbryggman/Prompts/blob/main/Images/big%20brain.png?raw=true)

A collection of prompts that I've made for my own use.

They're all based on handpicked prompts from https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts, which have then been re-formatted according to a standardized structure. I've found that this greatly increases the performance of the LLMs overall. Furthermore, I've suffixed some of the well-known methods of improving the output quality of LLMs at the end of each prompt, such as using Chain-of-Thought, adding emotional contexts, tipping, and more.

Included in each prompt is also a section regarding suggested LLM settings. These are not supposed to be included in the final prompt, but are rather meant to be used to adjust the LLM settings for that specific prompt, as the name suggests. For more information regarding these settings, have a look at the settings.md file in this repository.

Lastly, I would just like to mention that these are base prompts and are meant to be further adjusted according to your specific needs. For example, if you're using the Advertiser prompt to help you develop content for marketing campaigns, it would be much more effective if you also include previous examples of content that your company has used. This way, the LLM is able to better understand your brand and messaging, which of course positively impacts the overall results of its' generations.

All prompts are listed below, and are also available as a CSV file.

Enjoy.







They have all been seperated into distinct categories, and generalized where appropriate for ease of use.

Everything is released under the MIT license.

Regarding Temperature and Top P - these are variables that influence the creativity of the AI model and to which extent it adheres to the prompt.

If you're using ChatGPT, this is not relevant for you as these options are not available for ChatGPT users.

If you are using the API, however, and would like to know more about these variables, you can refer to the image below for some examples.
