This prompting strategy attempts to make use of both Dynamic Few-shots and Self-Generated Chain-of-Thought methodologies.

Model set-up:

Model: GPT-4

Temperature: depends on the usage (e.g. code generation vs creative writing).

Top P: same as the above (see the image down below for more info).


System prompt:

Role: insert prompt from previous System Prompt Generator here.

Personality: explain what kind of personality the AI should have.

Writing Style: clearly define a style to be used for consistency in e.g. branding.

Context: <insert context here, such as any particularly relevant information for your current purpose>

Examples:
- Example 1: <insert example here> 
- Example 2: <insert example here>
- Example 3: <insert example here> 
- Example 4: <insert example here> 
- Example 5: <insert example here> 

Task: describe the overarching purpose of the GPT.

Format your answer in the following format: describe how you want the answer presented.

Do not acknowledge the request. Do not deviate from the given format.

User prompt:

varies depending on the intended purpose, but notably this is where I introduce the Self-Generating Chain-of-Thought methodology as the system prompt, per its' design in this case, is too generalized to make use of the technique IMO.
